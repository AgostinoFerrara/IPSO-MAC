=================================Source code by Agostino Ferrara(c)==  

Macintosh version

This is a restored version of the IPSO V.2.1 program,   
developed in 1988-90.  It is NOT an update, so the beaviour   
of the original version have been deliberately retained.  

==============================================================   
IPSO was written in GW-Basic 1.1     
The compiler used for this MAC executable is QB64 v2.0.2:   
https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64/releases     

IPSO is an 'executable' and it is seen by Mac OS as a    
potential threat to its intergrity, so...., depending from    
your OS confinguration you could have different options to run   
the program for the first time (try in the order):  

a) 	Right-click or Control-click the app and select “Open”;   
b) 	Open System Preferences >Go to Security & Privacy panel    
   	> Select the General tab. and press 'Open Anyway' button;   
c) 	If any problem arises in running the program under    
   	Terminal, try to install the xCode Command Line Tools    
	  copying and pasting this command in the Terminal window:   

        xcode-select --install 

d) 	If you need to change the permissions of the program just    
	  Right click on the  program icon >Infomation > Permission    
	  > unlock  and change.   
e)	If you are here then 'Houston we had a problem'.....   

==============================================================   
I suggest to put the folder IPSO in the user directory but   
it should work from anywhere. Data files that are in the same    
directory of IPSO are easier to manage if you are not confident    
with command-line commands. To open the enclosed  DATI.IPS    
example file, input, when asked, the name without extension.    

xxxxx.IPS files use a comma separated values format (use   
DATI.IPS as reference to copy and paste other datasets through    
a simple text editor. Be sure to store data files as simple    
plain text (so set this in text editor preferences).  

Printer outputs are not anymore working. Despite all efforts,   
the original '80 sounds do not work under Mac compiled version,    
and I had not still understud why.  =:-((    

In the install folder you'll also find the original paper with   
the use and the description of functions and program. It is    
still in Italian,  as well as the software......
