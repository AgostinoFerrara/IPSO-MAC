=================================Source code by Agostino Ferrara(c)==  

Macintosh version

This is a restored version of the IPSO V.2.1 program, developed    
in 1988-90.  Because it is NOT an update, the behaviour     
of the original version have been deliberately retained.   

==============================================================   
IPSO was written in GW-Basic 1.1     
The compiler used for this MAC executable is QB64 v2.0.2:   
https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64/releases     

Being IPSO is an 'executable', Mac OS sees it as a    
potential threat to its integrity, so.... depending on      
your OS configuration, you may have different options for running     
the program for the first time (try in the order):    

a) 	Right-click or Control-click the app and select “Open”.    
b) 	Open System Preferences > Go to Security & Privacy panel     
	> Select the General tab, and select 'Open Anyway' button.      
c) 	In the case of troubles running the program in the      
   	Terminal, try to install the Xcode Command Line Tools by   
   	typing in Terminal the following command:    

        xcode-select --install 

d) 	If you need to change the program permissions, simply      
	Right-click on the  program icon ans select Information >    
	Permission  > unlock  and change.     
e)	If you are here then 'Houston we had a problem'.....     

==============================================================   
Although I suggest placing the folder IPSO in the user directory,     
it should work from anywhere. Data files in the same IPSO directory    
are easier to manage if you are not confident with command-line    
commands.  When prompted, enter the name DATI (without the    
extension) to open the enclosed DATI.IPS example file.     

xxxxx.IPS files use a comma separated values format with an      
information header. Look at DATI.IPS (to built similar files through      
any text editor) or read the enclosed file 'How to import data from     
excel'.     

Printer outputs are not anymore working. Despite all efforts,   
the original 80's sounds do not work under Mac compiled version,    
and I had not still understud why.  =:-((    

In the install folder you'll also find the original paper with    
the use and the description of functions and program. It is     
still in Italian,  as well as the software......
